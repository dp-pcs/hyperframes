# Step 4: Write the Storyboard

**Before writing anything, fully re-read these files:**

- **DESIGN.md** — your color palette, font rules, components, Do's/Don'ts. Every creative decision must be grounded in this brand identity. If it says "white backgrounds with purple accent" — plan light scenes, not dark moody ones.
- **`capture/extracted/asset-descriptions.md`** — read EVERY line. This is your menu of available visuals. Each line describes what the image actually shows (e.g., "translucent ribbons in orange, pink, and purple on white background" or "a high-speed train under a dark starry sky"). Use these descriptions to decide which assets belong in which beat. Assets you don't understand from the description — view them directly before assigning.
- **[techniques.md](../../hyperframes/references/techniques.md)** — 11 visual techniques (SVG path drawing, Canvas 2D art, CSS 3D, per-word typography, Lottie, video compositing, typing effect, variable fonts, MotionPath, velocity transitions, audio-reactive). Pick 2-3 per beat and specify them in the storyboard.

The storyboard is the creative north star. It tells the engineer exactly what to build for each beat — mood, camera, animations, transitions, assets, sound. Write it as if you're briefing a motion designer who's never seen the website.

Save as `STORYBOARD.md` in the project directory.

## Global Direction

Every STORYBOARD.md starts with global settings:

```markdown
**Format:** 1920×1080
**Audio:** [TTS provider] voiceover + underscore + SFX
**VO direction:** [voice character — e.g., "mid-age male, calm confident delivery,
Apple keynote register — economy of words, silence between sentences is a feature"]
**Style basis:** DESIGN.md (brand colors, fonts, components from the captured site)
```

**Global guardrails** — read [video-composition.md](../../hyperframes/references/video-composition.md) first. It defines the medium rules: density, color presence, scale, frame composition, and how design.md is brand truth not layout spec. Then apply these capture-specific additions:

- Use as many captured assets as the creative vision allows. Scatter framework icons around a dashboard. Layer enterprise photos behind stats. Use product screenshots as floating cards. The assets exist — use them generously.
- Use at least 2-3 different techniques from techniques.md per beat — not across the whole video, per beat. Don't default to basic fade/scale/opacity — mix in SVG path drawing, CSS 3D transforms, typing effects, counter animations, canvas procedural art. Each beat should feel like its own visual world.

**Underscore/music direction** (if applicable):

- Describe the mood, reference artists, when it swells or drops
- Example: "Minimal electronic. Warm sustained pad already playing when the video starts. Sits underneath everything, never competing with VO. Swells gently during the flex section, drops to near-nothing for the comparison, resolves on a final chord."

## Capabilities Discovery

Before writing any beats, run these commands and paste the output below the Global Direction section. This tells you what's available beyond the standard techniques.

```bash
# 1. Check installed registry blocks (VFX, transitions, components)
npx hyperframes list --installed 2>/dev/null || echo "No blocks installed"

# 2. Check available shader transitions
ls registry/blocks/ 2>/dev/null | grep -E 'chromatic|cinematic|cross-warp|domain-warp|flash|glitch|gravitational|light-leak|ridged|ripple|sdf|swirl|thermal|whip' || echo "No shader transitions in registry"

# 3. Check available VFX blocks
ls registry/blocks/ 2>/dev/null | grep vfx || echo "No VFX blocks in registry"
```

If VFX blocks are available (vfx-liquid-glass, vfx-iphone-device, vfx-shatter, vfx-portal, etc.), use them for hero treatments instead of basic perspective tilt. Install any you want with `npx hyperframes add <name>`. If shader transitions are in the registry, use them between beats instead of basic blur/fade — install with `npx hyperframes add <name>`.

**HTML-in-Canvas** (available in all HyperFrames renders): The `drawElementImage` Chrome API captures live DOM into a `<canvas>` as a GPU-accelerated texture. You can render any HTML/CSS through WebGL shaders, map it onto 3D geometry, or apply post-processing — even without VFX blocks. Read `docs/guides/html-in-canvas.mdx` for the API.

Do NOT list SFX files in the storyboard. SFX are wired in Step 6 (Audio Wiring) after compositions are built — matched to the creative direction, not the other way around.

### HTML-in-Canvas — the most powerful visual tool available

This is HyperFrames' standout capability. The `drawElementImage` API captures any live HTML/CSS as a GPU-accelerated texture at 60fps. This means you can take a captured product screenshot, a dashboard UI, a code snippet — any HTML content — and render it through:

- **3D geometry** — map it onto a rotating iPhone or laptop model, wrap it around a sphere, project it onto a curved surface
- **WebGL shaders** — liquid glass refraction, shatter into fragments, portal reveal, magnetic assembly, noise distortion, chromatic aberration
- **Post-processing** — bloom, depth-of-field, film grain, color grading — all running in real-time on the GPU
- **Custom effects** — anything you can write in Three.js or raw WebGL

When planning the storyboard, think about which beats deserve a cinematic HTML-in-Canvas treatment vs a standard GSAP animation. A product screenshot with flat perspective tilt is fine — but that same screenshot mapped onto a 3D device rotating in space with depth-of-field blur is extraordinary. A feature list sliding in from the right is adequate — but that list floating above a rippling liquid surface is memorable.

The API pattern: put HTML inside `<canvas layoutsubtree>`, call `ctx.drawElementImage(element, x, y, w, h)`, use as a Three.js `CanvasTexture`. HyperFrames auto-enables the Chrome flag during renders. Read `docs/guides/html-in-canvas.mdx` for code patterns. Pre-built examples exist via `npx hyperframes add --tag html-in-canvas`, or build custom effects from scratch. Spawn a sub-agent for complex Three.js/WebGL work if needed.

## Asset Audit

Before writing any beats, audit every captured asset. Print this table:

| Asset                          | Type       | Assign to Beat | Role                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ---------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| wave-fallback-desktop.png      | Hero image | Beat 1         | Full-bleed animated background        |
| enterprise-accordion-hertz.png | Photo      | Beat 3         | Enterprise credibility, Ken Burns pan |
| stripe-logo.svg                | SVG        | Beat 1, Beat 5 | Brand mark opener + closer            |
| datavizstatic3x.png            | Data viz   | Beat 3         | Supporting visual behind stats        |
| icon-3.svg                     | Icon       | SKIP           | Decorative, too small                 |

**Minimum utilization:**

- At least 50% of product screenshots and hero images must appear
- Brand logo appears in the first AND last beat
- The site's signature visual (gradient wave, hero illustration, key product UI) must appear — it's the most recognizable brand element
- Maximum 2 consecutive text-only beats. The 3rd must contain a visual asset
- Opening beat must contain a visual asset, not text-only

## Per-Beat Direction

Read [beat-direction.md](../../hyperframes/references/beat-direction.md) for the general beat template: concept, mood, animation choreography (energy verbs), transitions (shader vs CSS vs hard cut decision matrix), depth layers, SFX cues, rhythm planning, and velocity-matched transitions.

**Important:** The agent decides the number of beats and their durations based on the script and brand — there is no fixed beat count. Some videos need 4 beats, others need 8. Let the content dictate structure.

**CTA / closing beats** are consistently the weakest in auto-generated videos. Agents treat them as "logo + tagline + done" with minimal animation. A good CTA beat should be as visually rich as any other beat — the logo entrance should be an event (SVG path draw, scale bounce with overshoot), the background should have ambient motion, and the hold period should have continuous breathing/pulsing so no frame is static. Plan at least 15 GSAP calls for CTA beats, same as feature beats.

In the capture pipeline, each beat also includes:

### VO cue

Which narration line plays over this beat.

### Visual description

What the viewer sees — described cinematically, not as CSS specs. Use camera language (pan, zoom, drift, settle). Describe at least 5 visual elements, not just text + background. Think in layers — what's moving in the foreground, midground, background simultaneously?

### Assets

Which captured files to use, referenced by filename:

- "Background: `capture/assets/wave-fallback-desktop.png` — full-bleed, slow zoom 1→1.04 over beat duration"
- "Logo: `capture/assets/svgs/stripe-logo.svg` — centered, fades in at 0.5s"
- "Enterprise photo: `capture/assets/enterprise-accordion-hertz.png` — Ken Burns pan, 70% opacity overlay"

## Example: Beat-by-Beat Format

Here are three beats from a production storyboard showing the level of detail expected.

### BEAT 1 — COLD OPEN (0:00–0:05)

**VO:** "Your AI agent already knows how to make videos."

**Concept:** We're already in motion when the video starts. No title card, no fade from black. We're mid-flight over an infinite creative workspace — dozens of living compositions scattered below us like a city seen from a drone. Each one is alive, running a different animation. The message is clear before any words: this tool makes videos. Lots of them.

**Visual:** Slow smooth diagonal drift over a vast canvas (3600×2200px plane). Scattered across it: 25 composition cards at organic angles (±5-15° rotation), soft shadows, thin borders. Each card contains a DIFFERENT running animation — kinetic type, gradient morph, data viz, particle system, logo assembly, SVG drawing, shader noise, 3D rotating object. Depth-of-field: close cards slightly blurred, focal sweet-spot in mid-distance, far cards smaller and desaturated.

**Camera:** Diagonal drift top-left to bottom-right, slight 2-3° rotation over 5s. power1.inOut ease. Zoom accelerates in final second as we approach one specific card.

**Assets:** Product screenshots and logo on cards. Each card is a mini-composition with its own animation.

**SFX:** Ambient warmth pad already playing. Faint textured hum — overhearing creative activity from a distance.

---

### BEAT 5 — THE THESIS (0:20–0:24)

**VO:** "Anything a browser can render can be a frame in your video."

**Mood:** Big statement. This sentence gets its own canvas. Clean, spacious, typographic.

**Visual:** Words appear as staggered kinetic typography. "Anything a browser can render" — distinctive serif, gentle fade + rise (y: 24px → 0, opacity 0 → 1, 0.4s, power2.out). Held beat — one second of stillness. "can be a frame in your video." appears below. As the final word lands, the entire text pulses once — a brief warm flash, subtle scale bump to 101%.

**Transition OUT:** Whip pan left — x:-400, blur:24px, opacity:0.4, 0.3s power3.in

**SFX:** Silence under the first line. On the capture pulse — a soft analog shutter click.

---

### BEAT 7 — THE CONTRAST (0:38–0:44)

**VO:** "No new framework for the agent to learn. Just HTML."

**Mood:** Clean comparison. Light base. Two worlds side by side.

**Visual:** Left half: dense code, small, compressed, overwhelming. Scrolls slowly upward. Slightly desaturated. Right half: spacious HTML, syntax-highlighted, generous line spacing, inviting. On "Just HTML." — the left side folds inward along its center line, like a book closing. The right side expands to fill the frame. Warm glow rises behind it.

**Transition IN:** Zoom through — scale 0.75→1, blur 20px→0, 0.5s expo.out
**Transition OUT:** Velocity-matched upward — y:-150, blur:30px, 0.33s power2.in

**Assets:** Real framework code on the left (actual content, not lorem ipsum). Real HyperFrames HTML on the right.

**SFX:** Left side carries a faint low drone. On fold: drone cuts. Silence. Then a single clean chime as the right side expands.
