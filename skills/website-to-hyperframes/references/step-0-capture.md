# Step 0: Capture & Understand

## Run the capture

No API keys required for the base capture. However, before running, ask the user:

> "For the best results, it is recommended to set a Gemini API key — it gives me AI-powered descriptions of every captured image, which helps me choose the right assets for each scene. It costs about $0.001 per image. You can skip this if you want, but the video quality will be better with it. To set it up: add `GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key` to a `.env` file in the project root. You can get a free key at ai.google.dev."

If the user provides the key or already has one set, proceed. If they skip it, proceed anyway — the capture works without it, but `asset-descriptions.md` will have DOM-context descriptions only (position, size, alt text) instead of AI vision descriptions (what the image actually shows).

Create a project directory for your video if it doesn't exist yet, then capture the website into a `capture/` subfolder within it:

```bash
# Use the local CLI (includes paginated contact sheets and SVG root scan fixes):
npx tsx packages/cli/src/cli.ts capture <URL> -o <project-dir>/capture
```

Example: `npx tsx packages/cli/src/cli.ts capture https://stripe.com -o videos/stripe-launch/capture`

Keeping the capture artifacts (`screenshots/`, `assets/`, `extracted/`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`) in a dedicated `capture/` subfolder keeps them isolated from the later build files (`SCRIPT.md`, `STORYBOARD.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `compositions/`, `index.html`, `narration.wav`, `transcript.json`, `renders/`, `snapshots/`), which all live at `<project-dir>/` root.

For exploratory captures that aren't becoming a video yet, `-o captures/<name>` at the repo root is fine — the isolation convention only matters when you're building a video on top of the capture.

Wait for the capture to complete. Print how many screenshots, assets, sections, and fonts were extracted.

## Read and summarize

Read every file below. After each one, **write a 3-4 sentence summary** of what you learned. These summaries carry forward — the raw file content may be cleared from context later, and your summaries are what keep the capture data usable through the rest of the pipeline.

### Read these

1. **View the contact sheets** — these are labeled grids that let you see many images at once instead of opening them one by one. Contact sheets are paginated: look for `contact-sheet-1.jpg`, `contact-sheet-2.jpg`, etc. (or `contact-sheet.jpg` for older single-page captures). View ALL pages for each category.
   - `capture/screenshots/contact-sheet-*.jpg` — scroll screenshots grid. View FIRST. Each cell numbered with scroll percentage. List the directory if unsure how many pages exist.
   - `capture/assets/contact-sheet-*.jpg` — all downloaded raster images grid. Each cell labeled with filename.
   - `capture/assets/svgs/contact-sheet-*.jpg` — all SVGs rendered as thumbnails. Each cell labeled with filename. Check `capture/assets/` root too — some captures store SVGs there instead of `svgs/`.
   - `capture/screenshots/full-page.png` — the entire page as one tall image. Useful for scrolling animation videos.

   After viewing the screenshot contact sheets, write 3-4 sentences describing the site's visual mood, layout patterns, color strategy, and overall feel.

2. **`capture/extracted/tokens.json`** — Note the top 5-7 colors (HEX), all font families with their weights (e.g. `Inter (400,700)` or `Sohne (100-900 variable)`), number of sections, and number of headings/CTAs.

3. **`capture/extracted/design-styles.json`** — Computed styles extracted from live DOM elements. Contains: typography hierarchy (every text role with exact font-size, weight, line-height, letter-spacing), button variants (background, padding, radius, shadow), card/container styles, navigation styles, spacing scale with base unit, border-radius scale, and box-shadow values with usage counts. This is your primary data source for writing DESIGN.md Sections 3-6.

4. **`capture/extracted/visible-text.txt`** — Each line is prefixed with the HTML tag: `[h1] Heading`, `[p] Body text`, `[a] Link text`. Use these tags to understand hierarchy — headings are key messages, paragraphs are supporting copy. Strip the `[tag]` prefix if quoting text in the script.

5. **`capture/extracted/asset-descriptions.md`** — One-line-per-file summary of all downloaded assets. Note which assets are most visually striking or useful for video.

### Required to check and read IF they exist

6. **`capture/extracted/animations.json`** — See for yourself if the site uses scroll-triggered animations, marquees, canvas/WebGL, or named CSS animations. Just good to know.

7. **`capture/extracted/lottie-manifest.json`** — View each preview image at `capture/assets/lottie/previews/` to see what the animations look like. It will help you think of what you can do in the video.

8. **`capture/extracted/video-manifest.json`** — View each preview at `capture/assets/videos/previews/` to see what each video shows.

9. **`capture/extracted/shaders.json`** — If present, this contains the actual GLSL shader code that powers the site's WebGL visual effects (gradient waves, particle systems, noise fields). Read the fragment shaders to extract: color values used in gradients, noise algorithms, blend functions. You are able to recreate similar effects in your compositions using Canvas 2D, Three.js, HTML-in-canvas or by embedding the shader patterns with a `<canvas>` + WebGL context. Absolutely read the patterns in `techniques.md`!!

### Required On-demand (only when actually needed in Step 5)

10. **Individual images in `capture/assets/`** — The contact sheet pages cover all assets. Only open an individual file when:
    - You are placing text over a screenshot and need to check the safe zone / exact content at full resolution
    - A storyboard-assigned asset's contact sheet thumbnail is too small to judge its content

    Do NOT batch-view individual assets at this stage. That is what the contact sheets are for.

11. **`capture/extracted/assets-catalog.json`** — If you notice there is something interesting in remote URLs assets, you are more than welcome to use them!!

### For rich captures (30+ images)

If asset-descriptions.md has mostly bare descriptions (no AI vision — check if entries say things like 'icon: icon 0' instead of actual descriptions), launch a sub-agent to view and describe all of those.

## Carry-forward to Step 1

After reading `tokens.json` and `design-styles.json` here, **summarize the key values** (top colors, font families, key component styles) in your step-0 site summary. Step 1 reads your summary — it does NOT re-read these files. If your summary is thorough, Step 1 can write DESIGN.md without opening them again.

## Gate

Print your site summary before proceeding to Step 1 (DESIGN.md):

- **Site:** [name]
- **Colors:** [top 3-5 HEX values with roles]
- **Fonts:** [font families]
- **Sections:** [count] sections, [count] headings, [count] CTAs
- **Key assets:** [3-5 most useful assets for video]
- **Vibe:** [one sentence describing the visual identity]
